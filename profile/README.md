## Making Token Transfers 100% nuts

Peanut is a protocol to transfer tokens using URLs. Peanut Protocol uses secret-protected vault smart contracts. The sender deposits tokens to the vault and sends the URL to the receiver. The URL contains a secret, allowing the receiver to withdraw the funds.

- [SDK Repository](https://github.com/peanutprotocol/peanut-sdk)
- [UI Repository](https://github.com/peanutprotocol/peanut-ui)

## How It Works
It's super easy:
1. **Deposit**: Senders deposit tokens into a secret-protected vault contract.
2. **Share**: A unique URL containing a secret is generated.
3. **Withdraw**: The receiver uses the URL to withdraw the tokens from the vault.

Don't deal with wallet addresses and chain preferences, just send a link. You can send crypto tokens or NFTs through a URL like this:
`https://peanut.to/claim?c=matic&i=14&v=v3&p=8rDKrwSpC7TACqrl`
With Peanut, that's all it takes to move digital assets securely.
