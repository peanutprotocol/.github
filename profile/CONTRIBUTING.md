# Contributing to Peanut Protocol

First off, thx fren!

## Open Development

All work on Peanut Protocol happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

## Branch Organization

We will do our best to keep the `main` branch in good shape, with tests passing at all times. If you're making a significant change, you are advised to start a discussion first by opening an issue and discussing the changes before you start writing code.

## Bugs

We are starting to use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the details. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Please explain what you're doing
2. Make sure status checks pass. If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. 
3. While the PR is open, update the branch with any changes from the main branch.
4. Once your pull request is opened, a core team member will take responsibility for providing clear, actionable feedback.
5. We try to be as fast as possible.
